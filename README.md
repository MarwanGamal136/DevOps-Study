# LEMP stack 
LEMP stack is a software stack commonly used for hosting dynamic websites and web applications. It consists of four key components: 
**Linux** , **Nginx** , **MySQL** and **PHP** . Each component plays a specific role in the stack:

**Linux**: Linux is an open-source operating system and serves as the foundation of the LEMP stack. It provides the underlying infrastructure and security features required for running web servers.

**Nginx**: Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, lightweight web server and reverse proxy server. It is known for its efficiency and scalability, making it a popular choice for serving static and dynamic content over the internet.

**MySQL**: MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It provides a robust and scalable solution for storing and managing data. MySQL is often used in web applications to handle database operations, such as storing user information, content, and other data.

**PHP**: PHP is a server-side scripting language that is commonly used for web development. It is particularly suited for generating dynamic web content and interacting with databases. PHP scripts can be embedded within HTML to create dynamic web pages and process user input.

Together, these components form a powerful stack that enables the deployment of web applications. Linux provides the operating system, Nginx handles web server duties, MySQL manages the database, and PHP processes the dynamic content and interacts with the database.

A LEMP stack (On_Cloud) diagram would typically illustrate the different components of the stack and their interactions. Here's a textual representation of the diagram:
